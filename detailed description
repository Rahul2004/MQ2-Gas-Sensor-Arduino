As I currently reside in India, most of the houses here have a LPG -Gas stove system for cooking food and various other kitchen activities.
There are LPG cylinders which are used as a fuel source for the gas stove.

Many a times, disastrous accidents take place due to leakage of these cylinders, in these situations we must administer proper care and safety.

Keeping this in mind, in today’s post I have worked on MQ-2 gas sensor(FC-22) powered and interfaced with arduino uno.

Here is its datasheet :-

Arduino UNO or Genuino UNO
Breadboard
LED’s
Resistors
Jumper wires
